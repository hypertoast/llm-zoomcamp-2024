  "How can I tell if I might have depression?": "For a diagnosis of depression, a person needs to have experienced low mood or loss of interest or pleasure in life for at least 2 weeks. Also, they will have experienced the following symptoms: feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or irritability nearly every day.",
  "What's the main difference between feeling down and depression?": "Sadness is a normal reaction to a loss, disappointment, problems, or other difficult situations. Feeling sad from time to time is just another part of being human. In these cases, feelings of sadness go away quickly and you can go about your daily life. Other ways to talk about sadness might be feeling low, feeling down, or feeling blue. A person may say they are feeling depressed, but if it goes away on its own and doesn't impact life in a big way, it probably isn't the illness of depression. Depression is a mental illness that affects your mood, the way you understand yourself, and the way you understand and relate to things around you. It can also go by different names, such as clinical depression, major depressive disorder, or major depression. Depression can come up for no reason, and it lasts for a long time. It's much more than sadness or low mood. People who experience depression may feel worthless or hopeless. They may feel unreasonable guilty. Some people may experience depression as anger or irritability. It may be hard to concentrate or make decisions. Most people lose interest in things that they used to enjoy and may isolate themselves from others. There are also physical signs of depression, such as problems with sleep, appetite and energy and unexplainable aches or pains. Some may experience difficult thoughts about death or ending their life (suicide). Depression lasts longer than two weeks, doesn't usually go away on its own, and impacts your life. It's a real illness, and it is very treatable. It's important to seek help if you're concerned about depression.",
  "What's the real difference between stress and anxiety?": "Stress and anxiety are often used interchangeably, and there is overlap between stress and anxiety. Stress is related to the same fight, flight, or freeze response as anxiety, and the physical sensations of anxiety and stress may be very similar. The cause of stress and anxiety are usually different, however. Stress focuses on mainly external pressures on us that we're finding hard to cope with. When we are stressed, we usually know what we're stressed about, and the symptoms of stress typically disappear after the stressful situation is over. Anxiety, on the other hand, isn't always as easy to figure out. Anxiety focuses on worries or fears about things that could threaten us, as well as anxiety about the anxiety itself. Stress and anxiety are both part of being human, but both can be problems if they last for a long time or have an impact on our well-being or daily life.",
  "How do I know if I need to see a mental health professional?": "If your beliefs, thoughts, feelings or behaviours have a significant impact on your ability to function in what might be considered a normal or ordinary way, it would be important to seek help.",
  "What should I know before starting mental health medication?": "The best source of information regarding medications is the physician prescribing them. He or she should be able to answer questions such as:\n1. What is the medication supposed to do?\n2. When should it begin to take effect, and how will I know when it is effective?\n3. How is the medication taken and for how long? What food, drinks, other medicines, and activities should be avoided while taking this medication?\n4. What are the side effects and what should be done if they occur?\n5. What do I do if a dose is missed?\n6. Is there any written information available about this medication?\n7. Are there other medications that might be appropriate?\n8. If so, why do you prefer the one you have chosen?\n9. How do you monitor medications and what symptoms indicate that they should be raised, lowered, or changed?\n10. All medications should be taken as directed. Most medications for mental illnesses do not work when taken irregularly, and extra doses can cause severe, sometimes dangerous side effects. Many psychiatric medications begin to have a beneficial effect only after they have been taken for several weeks.",
  "What are the early signs of mental health issues in adults?": "Symptoms of mental health disorders vary depending on the type and severity of the condition.

  "How can I help someone who seems to be struggling with mental health?": "Although Pandora cannot substitute for professional advice, we encourage those with symptoms to talk to their friends and family members and seek the counsel of a mental health professional. The sooner the mental health condition is identified and treated, the sooner they can get on the path to recovery. If you know someone who is having problems, don't assume that the issue will resolve itself. Let them know that you care about them, and that there are treatment options available that will help them heal. Speak with a mental health professional or counselor if you think your friend or family member is experiencing the symptoms of a mental health condition. If the affected loved one knows that you support them, they will be more likely to seek out help.",
  "What should I expect when starting mental health treatment?": "Since beginning treatment is a big step for individuals and families, it can be very overwhelming. It is important to be as involved and engaged in the treatment process as possible. Some questions you will need to have answered include:\nWhat is known about the cause of this particular illness?\nAre there other diagnoses where these symptoms are common?\nDo you normally include a physical or neurological examination?\nAre there any additional tests or exams that you would recommend at this point?\nWould you advise an independent opinion from another psychiatrist at this point?\nWhat program of treatment is the most helpful with this diagnosis?\nWill this program involve services by other specialists? If so, who will be responsible for coordinating these services?\nWhat do you see as the family's role in this program of treatment?\nHow much access will the family have to the individuals who are providing the treatment?\nWhat medications are generally used with this diagnosis?\nHow much experience do you have in treating individuals with this illness?\nWhat can I do to help you in the treatment?",

Based on the nature of the illness, there are a range of effective treatments available. For any type of treatment, it is essential that the person affected is proactive and fully engaged in their own recovery process.

  "How can I maintain connections when feeling isolated?": "A lot of people are alone right now, but we don't have to be lonely. We're all in this together. Think about the different ways to connect that are most meaningful for you. For example, you might prefer a video chat over a phone call, or you might prefer to text throughout the day rather than one set time for a video call. Then, work with your social networks to make a plan. You might video chat with your close friends in the evening and phone a family member once a week. Remember to be mindful of people who may not be online. Check in by phone and ask how you can help. The quality of your social connections matter. Mindlessly scrolling through social media and liking a few posts usually doesn't build strong social connections. Make sure you focus on strategies that actually make you feel included and connected. If your current strategies don't help you feel connected, problem-solve to see if you can find a solution. Everyone feels lonely at times. Maybe you recently moved to a new city, are changing your circle of friends, lost someone important in your life, or lost your job and also lost important social connections with coworkers. Other people may have physical connections to others but may feel like their emotional or social needs aren't met. Measures like social distancing or self-isolation can make loneliness feel worse no matter why you feel lonely now. Reach out to the connections you do have. Suggest ways to keep in touch and see if you can set a regular time to connect. People may hesitate to reach out for a lot of different reasons, so don't be afraid to be the one who asks. Look for local community support groups and mutual aid groups on social media. This pandemic is bringing everyone together, so look for opportunities to make new connections. These groups are a great way to share your skills and abilities or seek help and support. Look for specialized support groups. Support groups are moving online, and there are a lot of different support lines to call if you need to talk to someone.",
  "What causes mental health problems?": "Challenges or problems with your mental health can arise from psychological, biological, and social, issues, as well as life events.",
  "Are there ways to prevent mental health problems?": "We can all suffer from mental health challenges, but developing our wellbeing, resilience, and seeking help early can help prevent challenges becoming serious.",
  "Is mental illness curable?": "It is often more realistic and helpful to find out what helps with the issues you face. Talking, counselling, medication, friendships, exercise, good sleep and nutrition, and meaningful occupation can all help.",
  "What's the first step in getting help for mental health?": "The most important thing is to talk to someone you trust. This might be a friend, colleague, family member, or GP. In addition to talking to someone, it may be useful to find out more information about what you are experiencing. These things may help to get some perspective on what you are experiencing, and be the start of getting help."
