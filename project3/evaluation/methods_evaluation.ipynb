Feeling sad from time to time is just another part of being human. In these cases, feelings of sadness go away quickly and you can go about your daily life. Other ways to talk about sadness might be feeling low, feeling down, or feeling blue. A person may say they are feeling depressed, but if it goes away on its own and doesn't impact life in a big way, it probably isn't the illness of depression. Depression is a mental illness that affects your mood, the way you understand yourself, and the way you understand and relate to things around you. It can also go by different names, such as clinical depression, major depressive disorder, or major depression. Depression can come up for no reason, and it lasts for a long time. It's much more than sadness or low mood. People who experience depression may feel worthless or hopeless. They may feel unreasonable guilty. Some people may experience depression as anger or irritability. It may be hard to concentrate or make decisions. Most people lose interest in things that they used to enjoy and may isolate themselves from others. There are also physical signs of depression, such as problems with sleep, appetite and energy and unexplainable aches or pains. Some may experience difficult thoughts about death or ending their life (suicide). Depression lasts longer than two weeks, doesn't usually go away on its own, and impacts your life. It's a real illness, and it is very treatable. It's important to seek help if you're concerned about depression.\n",

      "Ground Truth: Sadness is a normal reaction to a loss, disappointment, problems, or other difficult situations. Feeling sad from time to time is just another part of being human. In these cases, feelings of sadness go away quickly and you can go about your daily life. Other ways to talk about sadness might be feeling low, feeling down, or feeling blue. A person may say they are feeling depressed, but if it goes away on its own and doesn't impact life in a big way, it probably isn't the illness of depression. Depression is a mental illness that affects your mood, the way you understand yourself, and the way you understand and relate to things around you. It can also go by different names, such as clinical depression, major depressive disorder, or major depression. Depression can come up for no reason, and it lasts for a long time. It's much more than sadness or low mood. People who experience depression may feel worthless or hopeless. They may feel unreasonable guilty. Some people may experience depression as anger or irritability. It may be hard to concentrate or make decisions. Most people lose interest in things that they used to enjoy and may isolate themselves from others. There are also physical signs of depression, such as problems with sleep, appetite and energy and unexplainable aches or pains. Some may experience difficult thoughts about death or ending their life (suicide). Depression lasts longer than two weeks, doesn't usually go away on its own, and impacts your life. It's a real illness, and it is very treatable. It's important to seek help if you're concerned about depression.\n",

It can also go by different names, such as clinical depression, major depressive disorder, or major depression. Depression can come up for no reason, and it lasts for a long time. It's much more than sadness or low mood. People who experience depression may feel worthless or hopeless. They may feel unreasonable guilty. Some people may experience depression as anger or irritability. It may be hard to concentrate or make decisions. Most people lose interest in things that they used to enjoy and may isolate themselves from others. There are also physical signs of depression, such as problems with sleep, appetite and energy and unexplainable aches or pains. Some may experience difficult thoughts about death or ending their life (suicide). Depression lasts longer than two weeks, doesn't usually go away on its own, and impacts your life. It's a real illness, and it is very treatable. It's important to seek help if you're concerned about depression.\n",

Response: mental illnesses are health conditions that disrupt a persons thoughts, emotions, relationships, and daily functioning. they are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life. mental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life, such as certain phobias. on the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. these include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital. it is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a persons character, intelligence, or willpower. just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a medical condition due to the brains biology. similarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin, mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. these treatments are highly effective, with 7090 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life. with the proper treatment, it is very possible for a person with mental illness to be independent and successful.\n",

      "Method: semantic_search_question\n",
      "Ground Truth: Sadness is a normal reaction to a loss, disappointment, problems, or other difficult situations. Feeling sad from time to time is just another part of being human. In these cases, feelings of sadness go away quickly and you can go about your daily life. Other ways to talk about sadness might be feeling low, feeling down, or feeling blue. A person may say they are feeling depressed, but if it goes away on its own and doesn't impact life in a big way, it probably isn't the illness of depression. Depression is a mental illness that affects your mood, the way you understand yourself, and the way you understand and relate to things around you. It can also go by different names, such as clinical depression, major depressive disorder, or major depression. Depression can come up for no reason, and it lasts for a long time. It's much more than sadness or low mood. People who experience depression may feel worthless or hopeless. They may feel unreasonable guilty. Some people may experience depression as anger or irritability. It may be hard to concentrate or make decisions. Most people lose interest in things that they used to enjoy and may isolate themselves from others. There are also physical signs of depression, such as problems with sleep, appetite and energy and unexplainable aches or pains. Some may experience difficult thoughts about death or ending their life (suicide). Depression lasts longer than two weeks, doesn't usually go away on its own, and impacts your life. It's a real illness, and it is very treatable. It's important to seek help if you're concerned about depression.\n",

Response: stress and anxiety are often used interchangeably, and there is overlap between stress and anxiety. stress is related to the same fight, flight, or freeze response as anxiety, and the physical sensations of anxiety and stress may be very similar. the cause of stress and anxiety are usually different, however. stress focuses on mainly external pressures on us that were finding hard to cope with. when we are stressed, we usually know what were stressed about, and the symptoms of stress typically disappear after the stressful situation is over. anxiety, on the other hand, isnt always as easy to figure out. anxiety focuses on worries or fears about things that could threaten us, as well as anxiety about the anxiety itself. stress and anxiety are both part of being human, but both can be problems if they last for a long time or have an impact on our wellbeing or daily life.\n",

Response: mental illnesses are health conditions that disrupt a persons thoughts, emotions, relationships, and daily functioning. they are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life. mental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life, such as certain phobias. on the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. these include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital. it is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a persons character, intelligence, or willpower. just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a medical condition due to the brains biology. similarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin, mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. these treatments are highly effective, with 7090 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life. with the proper treatment, it is very possible for a person with mental illness to be independent and successful.\n",

It can also go by different names, such as clinical depression, major depressive disorder, or major depression. Depression can come up for no reason, and it lasts for a long time. It's much more than sadness or low mood. People who experience depression may feel worthless or hopeless. They may feel unreasonable guilty. Some people may experience depression as anger or irritability. It may be hard to concentrate or make decisions. Most people lose interest in things that they used to enjoy and may isolate themselves from others. There are also physical signs of depression, such as problems with sleep, appetite and energy and unexplainable aches or pains. Some may experience difficult thoughts about death or ending their life (suicide). Depression lasts longer than two weeks, doesn't usually go away on its own, and impacts your life.

    "    \"How can I tell if I might have depression?\": \"For a diagnosis of depression, a person needs to have experienced low mood or loss of interest or pleasure in life for at least 2 weeks. Also, they will have experienced the following symptoms: feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or irritability nearly every day.\",\n",
    "    \"What's the main difference between feeling down and depression?\": \"Sadness is a normal reaction to a loss, disappointment, problems, or other difficult situations. Feeling sad from time to time is just another part of being human. In these cases, feelings of sadness go away quickly and you can go about your daily life. Other ways to talk about sadness might be feeling low, feeling down, or feeling blue. A person may say they are feeling depressed, but if it goes away on its own and doesn't impact life in a big way, it probably isn't the illness of depression. Depression is a mental illness that affects your mood, the way you understand yourself, and the way you understand and relate to things around you. It can also go by different names, such as clinical depression, major depressive disorder, or major depression. Depression can come up for no reason, and it lasts for a long time. It's much more than sadness or low mood. People who experience depression may feel worthless or hopeless. They may feel unreasonable guilty. Some people may experience depression as anger or irritability. It may be hard to concentrate or make decisions. Most people lose interest in things that they used to enjoy and may isolate themselves from others. There are also physical signs of depression, such as problems with sleep, appetite and energy and unexplainable aches or pains. Some may experience difficult thoughts about death or ending their life (suicide). Depression lasts longer than two weeks, doesn't usually go away on its own, and impacts your life. It's a real illness, and it is very treatable. It's important to seek help if you're concerned about depression.\",\n",
    "    \"What's the real difference between stress and anxiety?\": \"Stress and anxiety are often used interchangeably, and there is overlap between stress and anxiety. Stress is related to the same fight, flight, or freeze response as anxiety, and the physical sensations of anxiety and stress may be very similar. The cause of stress and anxiety are usually different, however. Stress focuses on mainly external pressures on us that we're finding hard to cope with. When we are stressed, we usually know what we're stressed about, and the symptoms of stress typically disappear after the stressful situation is over. Anxiety, on the other hand, isn't always as easy to figure out. Anxiety focuses on worries or fears about things that could threaten us, as well as anxiety about the anxiety itself. Stress and anxiety are both part of being human, but both can be problems if they last for a long time or have an impact on our well-being or daily life.\",\n",
    "    \"How do I know if I need to see a mental health professional?\": \"If your beliefs, thoughts, feelings or behaviours have a significant impact on your ability to function in what might be considered a normal or ordinary way, it would be important to seek help.\",\n",
    "    \"What should I know before starting mental health medication?\": \"The best source of information regarding medications is the physician prescribing them. He or she should be able to answer questions such as:\\n1. What is the medication supposed to do?\\n2. When should it begin to take effect, and how will I know when it is effective?\\n3. How is the medication taken and for how long? What food, drinks, other medicines, and activities should be avoided while taking this medication?\\n4. What are the side effects and what should be done if they occur?\\n5. What do I do if a dose is missed?\\n6. Is there any written information available about this medication?\\n7. Are there other medications that might be appropriate?\\n8. If so, why do you prefer the one you have chosen?\\n9. How do you monitor medications and what symptoms indicate that they should be raised, lowered, or changed?\\n10. All medications should be taken as directed. Most medications for mental illnesses do not work when taken irregularly, and extra doses can cause severe, sometimes dangerous side effects. Many psychiatric medications begin to have a beneficial effect only after they have been taken for several weeks.\",\n",
